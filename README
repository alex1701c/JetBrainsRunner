-- Build instructions --

If cmake says "No targets specified and no makefile found." you have to delete the content of the build folder ( rm -rf build/* ) and try again.

cd /path/to/JetbrainsRunner
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DQT_PLUGIN_INSTALL_DIR=`kf5-config --qt-plugins` ..
make
sudo make install

Restart krunner to load the runner (in a terminal type: kquitapp5 krunner;kstart5 krunner )

After this you should see your runner in the system settings:

systemsettings5 (Head to "Search")

You can also launch KRunner via Alt-F2 and you will find your runner.

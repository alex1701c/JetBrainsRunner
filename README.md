## JetBrainsRunner

This plugin allows you to launch your recent JetBrains projects from Krunner.  
Furthermore the search suggestions and the application -> config file mapping can be customized.  
Additionally it has file watchers implemented, these reload the configuration when
new projects get added/removed.  

New Feature:
Now you can pin your projects by dragging the KRunner results to the taskbar or desktop.
